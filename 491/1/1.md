* **Volume**: large amnt of data that is continuously growing
* **Velocity**: rapid streams of data that must be processed in real time
* **Variety**: Structured and unstructured data obtained from (potentially) multiple data sources
* **Veracity**: Messiness/Trustworthiness of the data
* **Value**: Usefulness of the data

### Types of Data Analysis

###### Preliminary:

* Predictive modeling - Predicing the value of an unknown feature of the data

  - Predict the future price of a stock, etc.

* Cluter Analysis
  
  - To identify groups (clusters) of observations such that observations in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups

* Outlier Detection

* Collaborative Filtering


###### Less Complex:

* Queries

###### Least Complex:

* Descriptive Statistics
